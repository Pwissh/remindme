## What does that mean?
Remind Me is an extension I wrote for people to be able to set reminders to themselves. The reminders you set will send a notification to you at the exact time you set them to do! The reminders should be hashed/encrypted and stored locally also.

## Which one is which though?
[remindme_Mv2](https://github.com/Pwissh/remindme/tree/main/remindme_Mv2)(short for manifest v2) is the Firefox version while [remindme_Mv3](https://github.com/Pwissh/remindme/tree/main/remindme_Mv3)(short for manifest v3) is the Chromium version.

## Chromium browsers install guide (because I'm not paying 700â‚º to host a hobby project in their shitty store lmaooooo)

### Congrats, now you have the extension! Unfortunately you won't be getting automatically syncing updates like Firefox people does due to your shitty browser :c
