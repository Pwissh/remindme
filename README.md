# remindme
A browser extension designed to remind you about URL's or Notes in a specified time and date.

## What does that mean?
Remind Me is an extension I wrote for people to be able to set reminders to themselves. The reminders you set will send a notification to you at the exact time you set them to do! The reminders should be hashed/encrypted also.

## Which one is which though?
[remindme_Mv2](https://github.com/Pwissh/remindme/tree/main/remindme_Mv2)(short for manifest v2) is the firefox version while [remindme_Mv3](https://github.com/Pwissh/remindme/tree/main/remindme_Mv3)(short for manifest v3) is the Chromium version.
